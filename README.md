## Inspiration

Shortly after I finished reading React's and TypeScript's
documentations I've watched [The Coding Train's Coding Challenge
#171](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI_y2GAlQFM). I was already looking for
projects ideas to practice with those technologies, and something that relied on
a lot of differente states and was very visual seemed like a tight fit with
React, thus this project came to be.
