        I&apos;m Rudah Amaral, a Brazilian developer living in, at the time of
        writing, Nova Friburgo, Rio de Janeiro.
      </p>
      <p>
        I&apos;m usually hacking, tinkering and ricing my computers, nerding out
        with my friends about anything I&apos;m currently obsessed with, often
        video-games, and despairing about how I have so little time to enjoy my
        wide assortment of interests.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are reading this you should consider to follow, befriend or hire
        me! Choose your pick.
      </p>
      <p>See ya! o/</p>
