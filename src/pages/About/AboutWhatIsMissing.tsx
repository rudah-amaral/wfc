      <p>
        There are soooo many more features that I wanted to implement in this
        side-project.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, I want to move on from this project in order to learn
        new stuff and create new things. There&apos;s a time when you have to
        consider your pet-project &quot;done&quot; and I think I reached that
        point.
      </p>
      <p>
        So why not just list those ideas just for the fun of it? Someday when
        I&apos;m rested and willing I may return to this project and turn these
        dreams true. I also may not. So here they are!
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Add a PT-BR translation (CAMPE√ÉO DO MUNDO!! üáßüá∑ ‚òùÔ∏è ‚òùÔ∏è)</li>
        <li>Add support for multiple tilesets.</li>
        <li>
          Add the capability of selecting a subset of tiles from a given tileset
          that won&apos;t be used when generating (or the other way around).
        </li>
        <li>
          Add a tooltip next to each cell that expands to the avaible tiles in
          that cell instead of only showing its current entropy.
        </li>
        <li>And many, many more small improvements.</li>
      </ul>
    </>
  );
